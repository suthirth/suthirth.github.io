 My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of machine learning and medical imaging. More specifically, I am interested in the application of Deep Learning for cancer/ abnormality detection and segmentation. 

Keywords: Convolutional Neural Networks, Auto-encoders, Neuroimaging, Multiple Sclerosis, Glioma, Computer Aided Diagnosis
